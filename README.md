# I Am Poor!

This is an iOS app written in Swift. It is the opposite of my [I Am Rich!](https://github.com/techboyg5/I-Am-Rich-) app, which was inspired by an [early iOS app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich).

I developed this app as part of [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). I highly recommend getting it if you're interested in learning iOS app development!
